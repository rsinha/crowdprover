This is a crowdsourcing effort for program verification. We use program verification to prove that a computer program meets its specification. Most programs are large and complex. Programmers write them with no correctness guarantees, hence we need verification. However, automated verification algorithms are having a hard time verifying programs - we need your help, human!
